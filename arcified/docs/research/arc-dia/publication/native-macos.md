Part of [Track native builds and platform integration](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/3) and [the desktop roadmap](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/2).

## User outcome

Produce a macOS browser from the declared downstream source and patch series.

Type: implementation. Phase: Core desktop UX.

Disposition: Recommended core integration or verification, with improvements preferred over literal Arc replication.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Record toolchain, architecture, source revision, patch application and native build result.
- [ ] Launch and exercise navigation, an extension, a download, native menus, and profile restart.
- [ ] Keep signing credentials out of source and distinguish unsigned development builds from distributable releases.

## Starting point and close proof

The fork currently has an extension prototype. Inspect and reuse Helium's adjacent native features, then integrate or implement the missing contract. Extension tests alone never prove native behavior.

Target platform(s): macOS.

Verify the affected interaction in an installed native build on macOS. Attach focused behavior and visual evidence, source/build identity, and the named persistence/failure/accessibility cases. Record unavailable-platform checks as open. Extension-only checks cannot prove native behavior. Use public/synthetic fixtures for AI/service checks unless separately authorized.

## Prerequisites

No blocking implementation issue. Record any named owner decision before enabling optional behavior.

## Evidence and design intent

The linked fork source is baseline evidence. This issue proposes native integration or a design contract; it does not claim reference-app execution.

Reference platform support is limited to the cited source. Documentary macOS or Windows coverage does not prove native behavior; Linux is a downstream design and verification target.

- [Fork: blob/main/patches/series](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/blob/main/patches/series)

## Open decisions and limits

Native integration, failure behavior and applicable platform results must be proven for this slice; unavailable checks stay open.

Proposed work after native/reference prerequisites and explicit decisions in this issue.
