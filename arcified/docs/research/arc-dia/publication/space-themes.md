<!-- arcified-backlog:space-themes -->

Part of [Track appearance, input and onboarding](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/7) and [the desktop roadmap](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/2).

## User outcome

Give Spaces a distinct identity using an original visual system inspired by Arc's personalization.

Type: implementation. Phase: Core desktop UX.

Disposition: Recommended core integration or verification, with improvements preferred over literal Arc replication.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Edit colors, name, icon and light/dark behavior with a preview and revert.
- [ ] Text, selected states, window controls and web content boundaries remain legible in custom themes and forced contrast.
- [ ] Preserve appearance across restart and respect OS dark-mode changes without copying proprietary assets.
- [ ] Use platform-native materials where supported and a legible opaque fallback; never require a macOS-only material.
- [ ] Document support or a simpler deliberate replacement for intensity/grain controls and custom folder icons, using original assets.

## Starting point and close proof

The fork currently has an extension prototype. Inspect and reuse Helium's adjacent native features, then integrate or implement the missing contract. Extension tests alone never prove native behavior.

Target platform(s): Linux, Windows and macOS.

Verify the affected interaction in an installed native build on Linux, Windows and macOS. Attach focused behavior and visual evidence, source/build identity, and the named persistence/failure/accessibility cases. Record unavailable-platform checks as open. Extension-only checks cannot prove native behavior. Use public/synthetic fixtures for AI/service checks unless separately authorized.

## Prerequisites

- [Create and switch live Spaces in the native sidebar](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/32) (`spaces`)

## Evidence and design intent

The linked reference documents/release histories describe this workflow family. Acceptance below specifies the intended improved Arcified behavior.

Reference platform support is limited to the cited source. Documentary macOS or Windows coverage does not prove native behavior; Linux is a downstream design and verification target.

## Open decisions and limits

Native integration, failure behavior and applicable platform results must be proven for this slice; unavailable checks stay open.

Proposed work after native/reference prerequisites and explicit decisions in this issue.
