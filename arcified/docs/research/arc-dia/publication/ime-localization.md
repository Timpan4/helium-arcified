Part of [Track native builds and platform integration](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/3) and [the desktop roadmap](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/2).

## User outcome

Make command input, renaming and settings work for non-English input and layouts.

Type: implementation. Phase: Core desktop UX.

Disposition: Recommended core integration or verification, with improvements preferred over literal Arc replication.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Composition, candidate windows, dead keys and clipboard operations do not trigger browser commands prematurely.
- [ ] Handle Unicode, RTL, long labels and translated text without clipping actions or losing logical focus order.
- [ ] Exercise native input methods on each supported OS and keep strings externalizable.

## Starting point and close proof

The fork currently has an extension prototype. Inspect and reuse Helium's adjacent native features, then integrate or implement the missing contract. Extension tests alone never prove native behavior.

Target platform(s): Linux, Windows and macOS.

Verify the affected interaction in an installed native build on Linux, Windows and macOS. Attach focused behavior and visual evidence, source/build identity, and the named persistence/failure/accessibility cases. Record unavailable-platform checks as open. Extension-only checks cannot prove native behavior. Use public/synthetic fixtures for AI/service checks unless separately authorized.

## Prerequisites

- [Navigate and run browser actions from one command bar](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/77) (`command-bar`)

## Evidence and design intent

The linked fork source is baseline evidence. This issue proposes native integration or a design contract; it does not claim reference-app execution.

Reference platform support is limited to the cited source. Documentary macOS or Windows coverage does not prove native behavior; Linux is a downstream design and verification target.

- [Fork: blob/main/patches/series](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/blob/main/patches/series)

## Open decisions and limits

Native integration, failure behavior and applicable platform results must be proven for this slice; unavailable checks stay open.

Proposed work after native/reference prerequisites and explicit decisions in this issue.
