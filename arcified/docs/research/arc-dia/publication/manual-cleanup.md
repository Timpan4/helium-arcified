<!-- arcified-backlog:manual-cleanup -->

Part of [Track spaces and tab lifecycle](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/4) and [the desktop roadmap](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/2).

## User outcome

Provide explicit Clear Today and retained close-other/below actions independently from timed archive.

Type: implementation. Phase: Core desktop UX.

Disposition: Recommended core integration or verification, with improvements preferred over literal Arc replication.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Show affected window/Space scope and preserve unselected persistent items.
- [ ] Protect forms/audio/capture/downloads under the lifecycle contract and choose the resulting active tab predictably.
- [ ] Restore an accidental cleanup with order and provenance intact without form resubmission.

## Starting point and close proof

The fork currently has an extension prototype. Inspect and reuse Helium's adjacent native features, then integrate or implement the missing contract. Extension tests alone never prove native behavior.

Target platform(s): Linux, Windows and macOS.

Verify the affected interaction in an installed native build on Linux, Windows and macOS. Attach focused behavior and visual evidence, source/build identity, and the named persistence/failure/accessibility cases. Record unavailable-platform checks as open. Extension-only checks cannot prove native behavior. Use public/synthetic fixtures for AI/service checks unless separately authorized.

## Prerequisites

- [Browse and restore manually archived tabs](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/69) (`archive`)
- [Open and close temporary tabs within a Space](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/49) (`temporary-tabs`)
- [Settle native tab ownership and cleanup semantics](https://github.com/Timpan4/helium-arcified/issues/24) (`lifecycle-contract`)

## Evidence and design intent

REA 6.7.0 bundle/resource observations recorded in artifacts.md; no application execution or native-performance measurement.

Reference platform support is limited to the cited source. Documentary macOS or Windows coverage does not prove native behavior; Linux is a downstream design and verification target.

Static artifact lead: official Arc 1.170.0 build 89123 macOS DMG SHA-256 `5cf6d057e8944f847dac83d89b4d30d7a49c8974d02d29b35d2cf5afce9e36c1`; its MainMenu.nib SHA-256 `c05560f6665c062b78dd326c4ce56307154010f981a45f4959671fb460ab1963` has retained menu/action declarations (REA evidence `ev_cfff947c28d386fd3ea781438da8f9bf06f232c17b7f9431381cf4bf35d6306f`). This supports workflow discovery only, not callable/current behavior. Official Dia 1.54.2 build 89247 macOS DMG SHA-256 `7f0cb70555190ee1d36563b09a4ed5d8146e2eeaa4b3430bcb38bbce7e6ad913`; the portable compiled-interface decoder recovered updater dialogs, not its product UI. No runtime, native performance, signature verification or accepted decompilation result is claimed. Full native app inventories and partial Arc resource decoding succeeded; native analysis timed out. No proprietary implementation is copied.

## Open decisions and limits

Native integration, failure behavior and applicable platform results must be proven for this slice; unavailable checks stay open.

Proposed work after native/reference prerequisites and explicit decisions in this issue.
